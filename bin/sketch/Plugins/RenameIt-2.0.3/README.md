### Sequence
Type “%N” to name layer in sequence. You can also use “%n” for reverse order. The more Ns you add the more digits it will add (e.g. , Item %N ==> Item 1, Item 2, Item 3).
You can also set where to start the sequence from.

### Move Original Layer Name
Type "\*" to keep the original anywhere in the new name (e.g., Option \* icon).
